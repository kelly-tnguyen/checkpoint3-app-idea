# App Idea: Travel Suggestion App

* Why it needs to exist(what problem does it solve?)

    * Travelers don't know where to visit in a new place
        * Automatically scans and find best places to visit and things to do in a particular location based on your interests
        * Features that suggests the best restaurants, hotels, and has a review feature
        * Doubles as a blog "diary" that you can keep forever and write down all the places you personally love and include pictures - Can share this with anyone wanting to go here next

* How it solves the problem.

    * No need to search through thousands of websites when now you can have it compiled into one
    * Make planning so much easier by going on the maps page and pinpointing where they would like to go
    * Somewhere you can look back on all of the places you enjoyed
    * A quicker and more personable search of what to eat, where to go, where to stay all based on your preference

* What the app is and how it works

    * Users will open this app, put in their interests (hiking, foods, outdoor activities), and it will recommend all the places you should go. Not only will it include the big tourist spots, but it will tell you about the hole in the walls and other hidden gems.
    * Users will also have a section to have their personal diary and post all of their adventures on their trip so that pictures, thoughts, and ideas aren't jumbled everywhere.

* Show the class your first few pages of the web app.

    * Picture of a wireframe, or HTML/CSS mock up of what the landing page will look like

* What technologies will you use

    * I'd like to try to use ReactJS
    * Maybe Google has an API for their 'Explore' option so I can have a compiled list all in one application.
    * I might use a Maps API for users to also plan their trip accordingly where they can pinpoint where they want to go.

* What questions do YOU have about your app?

    * Will getting Yelp reviews on here be too much?
    * What is a good MVP (minumum viable product)? 
    * Anything to add that would make it a better idea?
    * Does something like this exist already..? It'll be like a Google Maps, Explore, Yelp, (maybe Reddit lol) and Medium combined all together!

* Receive feedback/questions from the class

    * ^ Yes, please. Feedbacks are very welcomed (and extremely needed lol)."# checkpoint3-app-idea"
